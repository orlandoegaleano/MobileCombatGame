Extras:
I added 3 more monsters and each have a "DEFEATED" image upon their death.
I added environment backgrounds for each screen and changed out the default icon assets as well.



Bugs:
1) Sometimes I have to press 'r' to reload the app because the expo client gets stuck on loading on initial startup.
2) If you kill the monster in one fell swoop, the damage the monster does to you does not show up in the combat log because it is updated to be a "You have killed X" string.
3) If you kill the monster but the monster also dealt a killing blow to the player, both the restart and continue buttons come on screen and the combat log says you defeated the monster instead saying you have been defeated.
